Ideas / Planning

- Moq ups?

---------------------------------

Here I'm scoping out my project, adding code snippets of ideas to use or what not.
For example, media queries, breakpoints, and I also learned about this responsive font size calc:

responsive font size--
font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);

image rotating--
.App-logo {
  height: 40vmin;
  pointer-events: none;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .App-logo {
    animation: App-logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
  }
}
