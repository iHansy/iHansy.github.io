Here I'm scoping out my project, adding code snippets of ideas to use or what not.
For example, media queries, breakpoints, and I also learned about this responsive font size calc:

responsive font size--
font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);

image rotating--
.App-logo {
  height: 40vmin;
  pointer-events: none;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .App-logo {
    animation: App-logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
  }
}

@keyframes App-logo-spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
